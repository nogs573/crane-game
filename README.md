# crane-game

Preliminary portfolio piece for work in Unity game engine. The goal for now is to create
an environment for a crane vehicle to interact with.

Scope:
- The player can drive the vehicle.
- The body should rotate and allow for extension of the crane arm.
- The perspective is in 3rd person by default, but there should be a toggle for 1st person.
- The mechanical parts of the machine should visibly extend and retract as the crane operates.
- If the hook at the end of the cable comes into contact with a "loop" sticking out of an object,
  a button and/or visual prompt should tell the player to press a key to pick up the object.
- There should be a button to release the object being held by the hook.
- There should be gravity affecting the objects in the scene.
